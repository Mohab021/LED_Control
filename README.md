# LED Control
Controlling an LED blinking through a variable PWM signal created by a timer.
LED Control Project runs on Cortex-M4 TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller.

## System Description
The purpose of this system is to simulate LED blinking Control through a variable PWM signal.
The system runs on Cortex-M4 TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller and interacts with:
- ON_Button
- OFF_Button
- LED
- Falling edge trigger interrupt
- SysTick

## Getting Started
### Executing program
